Simple spectral image viewer.

This program is in pre-alpha.

It has known bugs and **SHALL NOT BE TRUSTED** at its current stage.

There is plenty of known issue, e.g., incorrect scaling factor (100% zoom is not 1:1).

It partially supports OpenEXR spectral images. It does not support OpenEXR RGB, Y, YCbCr images.

Use it at your own risk.
