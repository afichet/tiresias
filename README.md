This program is in pre-alpha. It is a side project I made available to help a colleague. It was not meant to be publicly released.

It has known bugs and **SHALL NOT BE TRUSTED** at its current stage.

There is plenty of known issue, e.g., (far from exhaustive):
- Incorrect tone-mapping of reflective images
- Incorrect scaling factor (100% zoom is not 1:1)

It partially supports OpenEXR spectral images. It does not support OpenEXR RGB, Y, YCbCr images.

Use it at your own risk.
